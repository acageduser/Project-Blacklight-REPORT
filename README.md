# ProjectBlacklight
Security Audit of Website REPORT

Project Blacklight is a deep dive into the unseen tactics websites use to keep tabs on us, crafted by the hands-on research and investigative efforts of students. It's about unmasking the covert operations lurking behind web pages we visit daily, using Blacklightâ€”a tool designed to sniff out how these sites track every move we make online without our nod of approval. The goal? To pull back the curtain on the digital watchers and give power back to the people, letting us see exactly who's watching us and how.

In essence, the project is a call to arms for digital privacy, empowering users with knowledge about the secret surveillance mechanisms embedded in websites. Blacklight, the star of this show, is not just a tool; it's a revelation. It unveils the trackers and cookies that shadow our every click and scroll, the unseen scripts that report back on our online behavior, and the invisible watchers that record our every digital footprint.

The project's findings are more than a technical report. They are a stark reminder of the ongoing battle for privacy in the digital age, revealing how our online activities are monitored, recorded, and used without our consent. From ad trackers that peg us for targeted ads to keyloggers that can capture our most sensitive information, Blacklight exposes the gamut of tracking technologies that websites deploy to know us better than we might know ourselves.

But it's not just about pointing fingers. The project also turns the spotlight on how we can shield ourselves from these prying digital eyes. It explores browser add-ons and privacy tools that promise to keep our online lives private, highlighting the trade-offs between convenience and confidentiality.

By dissecting the privacy practices of big names like Coca-Cola, Microsoft, and Tesla, the project serves as a reality check on how even the most trusted brands manage our data. It's a wakeup call to users and a challenge to companies to prioritize user privacy over profit.

In conclusion, Project Blacklight isn't just a school assignment. It's a mission to demystify the complex web of online surveillance and reclaim privacy in our digital world. It's a testament to the power of transparency and the right to privacy in the internet era, serving as both a warning and a guide for navigating the digital landscape with our eyes wide open.
